 UFC Fight Predictor (Machine Learning Project)
Python, Scikit-learn, Web Scraping, Random Forest

Created a machine learning model using a Random Forest Classifier to predict UFC fight outcomes and methods based on fighter performance metrics.

Scraped and processed historical UFC fight data (2010â€“2024) and implemented automated data cleaning pipelines in Python.

Built a CLI tool to input two fighters and return predictions after live-scraping current stats from the official UFC website.

Achieved high prediction consistency by fine-tuning model parameters and optimizing input feature selection.
